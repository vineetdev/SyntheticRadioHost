Hinglish Prompt Engineering Explanation:

The prompt achieves authentic Hinglish by combining structural constraints with cultural linguistic patterns. 
First, it enforces phonetic spelling to guide pronunciation. 
Second, it mandates code-switching patterns—English sentences ending with Hindi tags like "hai na?"
 and "yaarrr"—mimicking natural Indian speech. 
Third, it includes one-shot learning with a concrete example demonstrating the desired style. 
Fourth, it specifies character personas (Mumbai energy, South Bombay curiosity) to create distinct voices. 
Finally, it requires conversational elements (fillers, interruptions, bracketed emotions) to prevent robotic output. 
The combination of explicit rules, examples, and cultural markers trains the LLM to generate natural Hinglish dialogue 
rather than formal translations.
